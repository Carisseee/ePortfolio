          <h2>Culture</h2>
          <p>As a Malaysian, I am proud to acknowledge that we are a multiracial country with 3 main races. They are Chinese, Malay and Indian. Therefore, each year there are a variety of celebrations, festivals and public holidays which we celebrate together as a nation. </p>
          <p>I am a chinese Malaysian so I celebrate Chinese New Year around February every year. As a Christian I also celebrate Christmas.</p>
          <p>During these celebrations, my relatives from different states or countries will gather in a restaurant where we have a private room just for our huge family gathering. However, since the pandemic is still ongoing we are no longer allowed to congregate in large groups, so we just have a simple potluck dinner over my grandmother’s house with some immediate family members.</p>

          <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
          <p>I discovered my passion towards cooking during the lockdown when dine in is prohibited. I was surprised that I can cook pretty well and thought I would almost turn my house into a home cafe. Furthermore, I also love taking pictures, especially pictures of food that I cooked and scenery.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
					<p>In this modern era, we are aware that technologies do wonders and ease our lives in many aspects. For instance, when my grandparents were kids back then, they never knew we could now reach out to people from overseas within seconds by just using our gadgets. As an inquisitive person, I am very curious and keen to find out about the theory behind these technologies. Therefore, I decided to pursue my degree that is related to IT. Not only that, people around me have been encouraging me to go for IT related degrees because there are plenty of job opportunities offered. </p>
          <p>During the pandemic, many things rely on technology. For example, many F&B companies, restaurants and fresh markets started using online platforms such as facebook and instagram to advertise or hold live sessions to sell their food and groceries. There was a surge in buying food and groceries online to stay safe at home and support local hawkers that couldn’t be in operation due to lockdown. With all the benefits stated, I started to be interested in IT.</p>
          <h2>A particular event and person that sparked my interest in IT</h2>
          <p>I was a student from bachelor of Computer Science before I transferred my degree to Information Technology. During the Programming Bootcamp 1 (one of the core subjects in Comp Sc), I was exposed to coding and enjoyed it. I enjoy coding not just because it is fun to play around but it also feels like I am communicating with a computer and giving them instructions. Sometimes, solving a question that I am stuck at or debugging the errors that I made in my program can seem challenging as it might take up to an hour or more but being able to resolve it gave me a sense of accomplishment. It helped even more that I have engaged a mentor who has been guiding me throughout my Comp Sc course which gave me a clearer picture of Java and gained more confidence in programming. </p>
          <h2>Reasons I choose RMIT</h2>
          <p>When choosing a university, the reputation and environment of a university must be taken into account and considered. It is undeniable that RMIT is very well known and worldwide recognised for its IT and design degree. They also offer a variety of IT related courses for undergraduate studies. Furthermore, RMIT is located in the city where everything is easily accessible and convenient for me as a first year student with no experience living abroad and alone.</p>
          <h2>Learning expectations as a student</h2>
          <p>I am looking forward to learning both software and hardware in depth. I also aim to learn as many programming languages as viable such as C++, Python, Java, HTML and more. I would be more than happy if I am able to master and be an expert in those languages that I learnt during the course. Other than course related subjects, self study before attending any of the lectures is one of the requirements in uni which I believe will shape me into a more independent individual in the future. Time management and self discipline are also some of the skills that I want to be able to improve during my studies in uni.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

					<h2>Job Title</h2>
          <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53061695?type=standout#searchRequestToken=54fbfe6e-1edf-4b59-83d6-dee38d65088d" >Business Consultant - Technology Advisory- APAC</a>
					<img src="idealJob.jpg" alt="job advertisement" style="max-width: 60%;max-height:60%;">
          <h3>Description</h3>
					<p>I have always wanted to be an IT business consultant ever since my friend first introduced me to this career option. He is currently holding a role of a manager in one of the Big Four companies - PwC from a consultant position. He is definitely someone I look up to a lot and want to follow his footsteps. However, I also want to give other careers a chance so I decided to do more research on those job advertisement websites. After going through and narrowing down the job scope that I might be interested in through a job advertisement platform,<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/"style="color: white">SEEK</a>.</p>
          <p>I personally feel IT jobs that are related to consultancy still stand out the most. I believe being a consultant is something I wish to pursue after I graduate / complete with my internship. It is due to the fact that I will be able to learn a lot as there will be various kinds of projects from different industries.Besides that, I love to have a more flexible work hour rather than a 9-5 one. Most importantly, the average wage of a consultant is relatively decent which is also one of the factors why this position is appealing to me.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The basic requirement to be a consultant is to at least complete a bachelor’s degree where I obtain technical skills and bridging complex technical concepts for the business users to understand . However, that is just part of the qualifications to be a consultant. Consultants play a very crucial part in every company. They need to make sure their clients are always in good hands. Hence, they need to have a very high level of responsibility and accountability. The main core of the job scope is the ability to problem solve and provide viable solutions for issues that clients face such as ensuring a smoother process flow in operation or improving business performance. Therefore, flexibility and analytical skills are highly valued too. </p>
					<h3>Skills I Have</h3>
					<p>During high school, I was a very active student and involved in many kinds of activities which were held in and outside school. By participating in those activities, I developed a lot of skills such as leadership, teamwork and interpersonal skills.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I have been fairly good at approaching and convincing others since young. As proof, I convinced my friends to purchase my sticker collections and managed to earn my first 100 dollars at the age of 10.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>I love giving myself challenges which force me out of my comfort zone and bring out the best in me. I believe participating in clubs, societies and events organised by uni or competitions that are associated with STEM would not only broaden my horizons and give me a better exposure to the real world scenario in the IT fields , these activities would also be an advantage in building my soft skills. For instance, I could volunteer myself to be a chairman of events or a leader when it comes to course projects. I will be able to learn to take up responsibility which will be helpful in my future career.On the other hand, completing a Bachelor of IT is inarguably one of the big stepping stones in pursuing my dream job which requires a certain background and knowledge of IT. In addition, online IT courses, hackathons and coding competitions will also help me to gain a better perspective in my journey as an IT professional. </p>

        <article>
          <h2>Results of these tests</h2>
          <p>According to the 16 Personalities test, I have an Entertainer personality (ESFP-T). It describes that this personality has traits of being extroverted, sensing, feeling and perceiving . I am also happy to find out that one of the suggested career choices is consultant. As highlighted in the 16 Personalities test description, it says that this characteristic is very practical and resourceful which I believe is what makes a good consultant. </p>
          <p>In addition, based on my Learning Preference Test, I scored higher in both visual and tactile which means the best method for me to remember or understand things is to visualise and touch or do it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, as stated on the Big 5 Test, I have the ability to think analytically which is also one of the crucial skills in the consulting industry as consultants need to constantly come up with ideas and solutions for their clients.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h2>Behaviour in a team based on these results</h2>
          <p>Based on the Big 5 Test, I have a bubbly personality and I can easily get along with anyone and everyone. On that account, I will be a good team player and contribute to whatever is the project of the team. An ESFP-T is also described as spontaneous and energetic. Therefore, I will create a positive and fun environment for my teammates irregardless of what we’re working on. Furthermore, as long as I know what the goal of the team is, I will be able to drive my team towards the best results. On the other hand, an ESFP-T is said to be more emotionally sensitive, therefore I can easily gauge my teammates’ feelings and emotions better than the average individual which will help maintain team harmony.</p>
          <h2>Things to take into account when forming a team</h2>
          <p>As mentioned above, I would consider myself as an extrovert. Hence, with the personality that I have, I strongly believe that I can easily approach introverts.Since forming a group is all about relying on each other's strengths to bounce off creative ideas and allows a more vibrant atmosphere and fun to work with. This would help them in expressing their ideas and thoughts without having a sense of withdrawal when working as a team. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The technology of virtual reality was first invented in 1957 by Morton Heilig (Bridget Poetker 2019). And in recent years, virtual realities are commercialised in the gaming industry. Though virtual reality exists, as far as I know a ‘live VR’ has not been invented yet. It is a tool that will project an ongoing activity or event to people on the other side of the country / world ( basically in any place at any time ). </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>This project idea was inspired during the outbreak of covid-19 and the prevalence of depression in people of different ages. In my point of view, the pandemic has changed everyone’s lifestyle drastically, especially when travelling and gathering is prohibited. Therefore, some people start to withdraw themself from the world as we are only allowed to stay at home until the lockdown is lifted.</p>
          <p>In the statistics shown below, the present global rate of depression has increased significantly to a worrying state (Panchal, Kamai, Cox, Garfield 2021). Actions should be taken by all individual to minimise the increasing percentage of people who suffer from depression as this may lead to suicide. </p>
          <p>Besides that, this ‘live virtual reality specs’ can be used for concert and travel purposes too. </p>
 					<img src="rate-of-depression .png" alt="statistics of global rate of depression" style="max-width: 70%;max-height:70%;">

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The design of this project idea will mainly be a combination and modified version of a virtual reality headset and an Apple's AR spectacle. This ‘live virtual reality’ tool comes in a form of spectacles which is less bulky and heavy compared to the virtual reality headset we saw in the market these days. A 3D effect will be displayed once wearing on the ‘live virtual reality specs’. </p>
          <p>This ‘live virtual reality specs’ is compatible with phones and a 360° camera. It can simply be explained by the concept of us enjoying a 360° view of a scenery on our phone but a 3D effect that will be displayed using the ‘live virtual reality specs’. This will be something new and interesting for everyone to experience. </p>
          <p>In the midst of this pandemic, many outdoor activities, in particular activities that would cause a huge crowd gathered in an enclosed area are banned. In consequence, many events are forced to call off during this period of time. The ‘live virtual reality specs’ will allow all events to be carried out smoothly at one’s home which will help to avoid the outspread of the virus unconsciously. </p>
          <p>As mentioned before, the ‘live virtual reality specs’ can be commonly used for 3D video calls. </p>
          <p>A 360° camera can be widely used in more formal or big events such as company meetings, performances, exhibitions, etc..</p>
          <p>Many meetings and classes are now carried out online via Zoom, Microsoft teams , etc… People often feel less motivated because of the surrounding environment and ambience. However, with the invention of this ‘live virtual reality specs’,classes and meetings will be more lively as people will feel like they are in the office or lecture hall respectively rather than just sitting and being in front of the screen. They are more likely to engage themselves and can have a “face-to-face” interactions with one another This tool will be helpful in getting people to involve themselves in their daily activities. </p>
          <p>Concerts can also be carried out through this ‘live virtual reality specs’. A 360° camera will be required during the concert to enable fans to have a full view of the performance. At this point of time, they will also get to have a chance to be in close contact with their idol virtually. It will definitely be a very immersive, exciting and unforgettable experience.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, virtual travelling is made possible through these ‘live virtual reality specs’ too. People will be able to see the world in a more realistic way without being physically there due to the 3D effect that is carried out by the ‘live virtual reality specs’. </p>
          <p>The possible obstacle of this project might be the cost of the ‘live virtual reality’. Marketing it at a reasonable price is relatively difficult as the hardware and software required to build this tool is not straightforward and would require a lot of manpower. I would call it success if the price of this tool is affordable for all individuals so everyone will get a chance to own it. Hence, recycled material can be considered in making the exterior of the ‘live virtual reality specs’ to reduce the price of raw material. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Code editors such as Visual Studio Code , Atom , notepad and IntelliJ are the examples of open source tools that are available for everyone which is one of the essential steps that should be taken in the preparation of inventing the ‘live virtual reality specs’ for program writing. The hardwares required to build this ‘live virtual reality specs’ are a processor, an operating system and a USB port.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>A good programming and coding skills is certainly required to ensure this tool is functioning and operating well. However, I personally think that Python will be perfect for this project as it is beginner friendly and more straightforward to be written.Besides that, the frame of the spectacles will be made up of recycled material such as plastic, a bit of metal and glass for the lenses. High resolution projector that comes in a miniature size will be perfect for the ‘live virtual reality specs’ to display high quality videos and also to ensure the projector is featherweight so there won’t be a burden for users to wear on.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If this project is successful, people are allowed to feel more connected with each other despite the lockdown and restrictions set by the government. This ‘live virtual reality’ will enable people to have a day-to-day conversation as if they are conversing with each other in real life and face to face in spite of being far from each other. Furthermore, this tool will also be able to help people who are abroad either for work or study to overcome homesickness, especially for those international students who are currently living alone in a foreign country.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases will be reduced drastically or everyone can be free from Covid-19 since people don’t have to be in close contact to feel connected to each other which also indirectly reduces the spread of virus.</p>
					<p>Primarily, I believe with the invention of this ‘live virtual reality specs’, the chances of people suffering from depression will be reduced to its minimum. </p>
